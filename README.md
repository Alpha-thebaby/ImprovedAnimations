### **üìò Description**
We are excited to announce our latest addition to enhance your Minecraft experience. Our new Minecraft Improved Animations mod features a range of cool animations that make the game more enjoyable, from basic movements like walking and sprinting to more complex actions like jumping, sprint-jumping, swimming, sword slashes, fist punching, sneaking, and falling. So, get ready to immerse yourself!

<summary><h3><b>üìä Mod Status</b></h3></summary>

Improved Animations was originally called Trainguy's Animation Overhaul, but the mod was never released to Curseforge or Modrinth. At the time (End of 2022 beginning of 2023) of forking (copying) the mod Trainguy had abandoned it to work on other things. DrAlpha asked if he could have permission to continue the mod with the intent of uploading it to Curseforge and Modrinth for, as he says "not for the profit, but for the Minecraft community". According to DrAlpha Trainguy gave him a vague response that DrAlpha interpreted as a go-ahead to continue the mod, so MincraftEinstein, Kelvin285, and Qboi were brought in by DrAlpha do continue the mod since DrAlpha can't code. After the mod was released Trainguy posted on Twitter (now X) saying that permission was never given to DrAlpha to continue the mod and reported the projects on Curseforge and Modrinth. We attempted to talk with Trainguy saying that the mod was licensed under CC0 ([Creative Commons 0](https://creativecommons.org/public-domain/cc0/)) meaning it was free to use by anyone for anything, but we would gladly add him as a member of the project on Curseforge and Modrinth and give him most of the profits that the mod generated. Unfortunately, we forked (copied) the mod from another fork of the original which was licensed under the [GNU](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html) license with parts of the mod (mainly the animations files) being under ARR (All Rights Reserved) meaning we not only didn't have permission we also didn't have the license to back us up though we didn't realize it until a little later. MincraftEinstein's discord server blew up with people saying that we had stolen the mod and hating on us for it, so we archived the mod files on Curseforge and Modrinth realizing that we had unintentionally stolen the mod and released it without permission. The very next day Curseforge and Modrinth took the mod pages down saying we were breaking copyright and so the mod can no longer be continued due to ownership reasons.

We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused. If you are interested in the original you can find it [here](https://github.com/Trainguy9512/trainguys-animation-overhaul)
